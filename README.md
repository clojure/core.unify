clojure.core.unify
========================================

core.unify is a Clojure contrib library providing the following features:

* Factory functions for constructing unification binding, subst, and unification functions, with or without occurs checking

* Packaged functions for unification binding, subst, and unification functions, with or without occurs checking, recognizing variables tagged as symbols prefixed with `?` characters

core.unify is based on a library named Unifycle, found at http://github.com/fogus/unifycle that has been deprecated.

Differences from core.logic
===========================

core.unify provides a la carte unification facilities that are not deeply tied into the operation of a logic engine. While core.logic does provide a similar simple unifier interface with support for specifying fine-grained constraints, if you have no need for a logic programming system, core.unify may be a better fit.
